# SARS-CoV-2-viral-shedding-dynamics
**Forked from [the repository](https://github.com/HPRURespMed/SARS-CoV-2-viral-shedding-dynamics) for the paper:** Onset and window of SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness and temporal correlation with symptom onset: a prospective, longitudinal, community cohort study.
All data and original code remains theirs.

Contains an adjusted model (to improve convergence) and the ability to compute a duration of positivity from the posterior distribution.
